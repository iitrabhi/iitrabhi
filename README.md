I am a simulation engineer with doctorate in computational mechanics. I love scientific simulation and teaching complex ideas with interactive tools. I'm good with Python and JavaScript. In 2019, I had the honor of being selected to work on the FEniCS project, a high-performance computing (HPC) simulation library, as part of the Google Summer of Code program, collaborating with scientists from Luxembourg and Cambridge University. 
<br>
<br>
Participating in GSoC opened my eyes to the power of open-source computing. Since then, I've developed multiple software packages using FEniCS, which have contributed to 10 academic papers and presentations at various national and international conferences.

Driven by my interest in interactive teaching, I founded <a href="https://eigenplus.com/">eigenplus.com</a>, aiming to make students fall in love with mechanics by building better interactive experiences.
